# Projects

## Precision Factor Analysis R Package (ongoing)
* Working with Abhra Sarkar and Noirrit Chandra on creating and documenting an R package that
implements the graphical model estimation methods developed in their paper:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11316
* Visualizes data with R packages GGally and ggplot2
* Implements estimation methods that require no parametric assumptions and have notable improvements in accuracy and execution time compared to current methods
* The framework estimates both the precision matrix and the marginal CDFs through a normal copula
* Performs Bayesian inference using algorithms optimized in C++ and integrated with R
* Performed example statistical analysis on public domain genomic data and summarized results in
package vignettes and documentation files

## [Pollution Heat Map](https://rainbowschubert.shinyapps.io/Pollution_Heat_Map/)
* Web app with interactive raster heat map of estimated pollution levels in California built in R Shiny.
* Collected, cleaned, and analyzed 74,192 rows of raw Excel data in R by subsetting rows and columns
and removing outliers from data
* Used kriging to construct a geostatistical model that estimates ozone pollution levels in unsampled
locations with R-squared = 0.76
* Integrated Google Cloud API to prepare data for analysis
* Allows user to specify a city in California, and the app will visualize the cityâ€™s location on a heat map
and estimate the pollution and risk level in that city

## [Palmer Penguins Analysis](https://github.com/rainbowschubert/Palmer-Penguins-Analysis)
This is an analysis of the famous Palmer penguins dataset. In the report, we use Python (particularly the SciPy software stack) to look for patterns in the data and construct a machine learning model that predicts a penguin's species based on other factors (flipper length, height, weight, etc.). Our logistic regression model predicts penguin species with 96-97% accuracy based on
flipper length and culmen length.
